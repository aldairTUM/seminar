1;18;0;1;2;At least in option A, some people still maintain their job, or at least get a new job. In option B people lose their job and the jobs are practically disappear, because robots replace them. That is bad for our economy. What if all business starting doing that? replacing their employees with robots. No jobs would be left. And the whole purpose of business that contribute something to society (employment) would be lost.      So, Option A.;2;10;1
2;24;0;1;2;If there is no significant difference in out put when replacing employees with robots then it would be better to give jobs to people who might need them.;6;10;1
1;18;0;1;2;I think the more ethical choice would be to chose a human employee versus a robot. If I were part of this company I wouldn't like to work with a robot. Furthermore I believe that choosing a robot would result in uprising questions about the companies goals. I also believe that hiring the right human employee would benefit the company more than a robot as they are more competent and have more experiences. ;2;10;1
2;21;0;1;3;In the future most people are going to be replaced by robots. It is cost efficient and maybe better for the company but I prefer that a human being would make decisions and work hard for a task. In that way people will develop themselves and learn more about life.;3;6;1
2;18;0;1;2;It is ethically better to create employment even though robots may cost less money.;2;10;1
1;22;0;2;2;you replace people for other people, then you should train the onces you already have.  Robots replacing people is so much: cooler and effectieve and innovative, THAT IS THE FUTURE;3;4;1
1;18;0;1;2;For the employment rate in this area is work important for these people, because of the current economic situation. ;2;4;1
2;19;0;1;3;If robots take the places of other people than there are no working spaces left for people. If it is replaced by other people than it is replaced by people without a job.;2;4;1
2;19;0;1;3;I prefer to work with people over robots. A robot can't be a motivator for the rest of the company, it can't do anything else than what it is programmed to do and you can't learn a robot anything. Where people can learn to do new things and make progress and they can make there coworkers feel more at home because there can also be an informal relationship.;2;4;1
1;18;0;1;2;I think it's a difficult choose between people and robots. But if they are both better, I will prefer people, because they need work. ;2;1;1
1;17;0;2;2;I think that it is easier to replace the employees by robots, as new employees do also need to be trained and motivated, while robots only need to be programmed in order to get the job done. In addition, robots will do everything that needs to be done (like working overtime), while employees are not always as obedient and do not always have the time to work overtime. Therefore, I think that it will be smarter to invest in robots rather than in new employees.;3;10;1
2;21;0;1;2;Humans need money to earn a living, robot's don't. Now I know that sooner or later robot's will takeover a lot of the jobs, just look at the self-driving cars now, when they become better driven than people can drive them all transport will be done by self driving trucks and the insurance companies would love that idea as well.    So i guess in the story there could be a bit more context, of course some jobs are better left to people and some other jobs that could greatly increase a company's efficiency by switching to robots should be switched to robots.;3;1;1
2;19;0;1;3;i trust real humans more when performing a task, and else people won't have work;2;1;5
2;18;0;1;2;It's it better for the economy, the company and the employees themselves if there are a lot of people working instead of doing nothing.;2;4;1
2;18;0;2;2;I think robots are a better option when we are looking at the future. Besides robots do not get pregnant or something, so robots are in general better for the continiousness of the organisation.;2;1;1
1;19;0;2;2;I chose for the robots, since I believe it is unfair to fire employees and then hire people from an external supplier to do the exact same task.  I think the employees would feel less 'damaged' with their job loss if the company replaces them for robots, as robots are computers. Also, the employees might find it interesting that robots will fulfill their tasks, opposed to feeling left out because other employees are now doing their jobs.  If I were an employee at this company, I would feel betrayed if the company fires me and then hires new employees, since they had fired me with the excuse that there wasn't enough money.;4;1;1
2;20;0;2;2;Robots are better than people. You probably don't need as many robots as you need people. When you look at a longterm perspective this will be more efficient. ;2;4;1
1;19;0;2;3;The robots will stay longer in the company and will always work;2;10;1
2;20;0;1;2;"Times are tough. If there is already a loss of jobs I would prefer that at least another human can get the job. If they would be replaced by robots; there will be more unemployment. Although robots might be more effective. ";3;10;1
1;19;0;1;2;I prefer to replace the employees with new ones, because replacing people with robots is something that can be quite depressing for the employees. Furthermore you still create job opportunities for people. Replacing them with robots means that you offer less job opportunities. In addition, you also reach your goals with people so this option is a fair choice for the company and future employees.;2;10;1
2;19;0;1;2;I would choose replacing the people with new people because replacing the people with robots will lead to an increase in the unemployment rate, thing that will affect the economy of the country. By increasing the unemployment rate, wages will go down and the amount of output will also go down, workers will not be able top bargain a higher wage because there would be a large amount of people unemployed willing to replace them for a lower wage.;3;10;1
2;20;0;1;2;I prefer replacing human employees with human employees instead of robots, because there would be no loss of available jobs. Robots don't need money, people do.   Since the company doesn't have a disadvantage between robots and humans, since the goal is achieved and humans don't cost more than the robots, there is no backfire from employing humans. However, if the robots would be much much much cheaper than the humans I would prefer to employ robots.    It's a choice you have to make between the ethics of not employing and therefore helping another human being, or going for the most profit.;3;10;1
1;18;0;2;2;Because if the company gets new employees, the current employees will feel replaced. And the company has to get used to the new employees and the other way around. While if you choose robots the old employees would feel like they've been replaced by something better other than just new employees from the outside.;2;10;1
1;21;0;1;2;if there is the need to replace the employees i would always go for other humans. since people need work to generate income and serve their families. we cannot replace everything my robots and leave employees unemployed. out of a human mindset i would select the other employees since both options lead to the same output;2;10;1
1;18;0;1;2;I think that when you chose robots over people, a lot of jobs would disappear. When you fire the employees, and replace them with new employees, there is still a job available for human beings. When you don't, and the robots take over the jobs of human beings, there is not enough work for people and that would cause a lot of problems.;2;1;1
1;200;0;1;2;I would prefer new employees to do the task as this way some jobs get lost but new are established. Furthermore, robots may break down and there need to be constant check-ups. Still, my main concern is the human aspect, as robots would negatively influence the working atmosphere in my opinion it is way more enjoyable to work with humans than with robots. ;2;8;1
1;19;0;2;2;People are rational or emotional. You can control them less. People can have personal problems, become tired or they can have a bad day. Robots will perform at a stable level. Of course robots can be broke, but you can more easily get rid of them than when people become ill and you have to pay salary for them.;3;4;1
1;19;0;1;1;I perceive differences between the choices where humans are people and robots are computers. Humans have a family who needs an income to live. They need jobs to earn money. If you use robots, there are humans without a job and with the consequence that they cannott feed their family. In addition, people have emotions and they can think about new alternatives for production when necessary. Robots cannot. ;3;4;1
1;18;0;1;3;I think human need to work and because of machines there will be a high unemployment rate ;2;10;5
2;18;0;1;3;if employees are going to be replaced by robots we will cause 'werkeloosheid'  robots can not replace employees;3;4;1
2;19;0;2;2;If you fire people, you have to give them a reason. The reason in this case is cost reduction. However, people that are replaced by new (cheaper) employees might feel a lot of frustration. They think: why couldn't I just stay, I have way more experience here.  If a robot on the other hand replaces you. It is not nice to hear that but you can not compete with a robot as a human in a way. If a robot is able to things more cheaply then that is a better reason than just replacing employees by cheaper employees.;2;4;1
1;18;0;2;3;If you choose for the robots, you will have less people to deal with. This means that you have to pay less people, and it's less stressful to work with robots than to work with people (you have to train the people etc). ;2;4;1
2;18;0;2;3;On the fact how you treat people. Option B actually says: the current employees are not good enough, we need new ones. Meanwhile option A (robots) states: Our current employees can't compete with the fast robots, it's not totally their fault, the technology is just to good.  You don't insult your current employees with Option A, don't get bad advertisement and reputation. And most of all: Robots are probably faster than the new employees;2;10;1
1;19;0;1;3;If cost reduction are achieved and productivity stays the same in both cases, it would be more moral to have employees doing the job. ;2;10;1
1;20;0;1;2;If the results are the same, it would be better to offer some job opportunities to people. I would understand opting for the robots, had there been a huge difference in costs and output. However, if there isn't I would always opt for human employees. ;3;10;1
1;18;0;2;3;By replacing employees by other employees, the old employees might think they are not good enough and feel very bad about it. By replacing employees by robots, the old employees will 'understand' why they have been replaced and will be less sad about it than they would be by replacing them with other employees.;2;4;1
2;18;0;1;2;I would choose for getting new employees instead of robots if the reduction of the costs is the same, because you will then still have social interactions with people. I think it would be pretty boring with robots, because you can't talk with them. I think you can also be more motivated by other employees than by robots.;2;10;1
2;18;0;1;1;I chose the people because the are more creative when it comes to problem solving. Robots may not strike or complain about anything but when a problem occurs they won't do anything because they are not programmed to react and solve the problem. This is a high risk and does not outweigh the benefits.;2;10;1
1;19;0;2;2;Als de werknemers toch weg moeten, zou ik het erger vinden als deze verplaatst zouden worden door nieuwe mensen dan door robots. ;2;10;1
2;19;0;2;3;I feel like robots would be better co-workers and it is easier to work with them;2;4;1
2;17;0;1;2;Employees are people so it would be nicer to work with people rather than robots because of the social aspect. Besides, you give people a job who would be unemployed if you didn't contract them. ;2;10;1
2;18;0;2;2;Well exchanging humans for humans is a harder choice to justify to the public whereas everybody understands the concept of replacing 'human labour' by 'robot labour'. The description states that the output will be the same but at the back of my head I had information (e.g. robots don't go on strike, robots don't need lunch breaks, robots don't question authority and so on) which further influenced my choice.;2;10;1
1;20;0;1;2;I prefer people, because it offers them a job. And people can control if everything is going well.;2;10;1
2;18;0;1;2;I would like for everyone to have a job, so if employees got replaced by other employees I wouldn't mind very much, because the same number of people would have a job. If people got replaced by robots, overall more people would be without a job, so I don't prefer that option.;2;4;1
1;18;0;1;2;By replacing with robots, people will lose their jobs and getting less wealthy. It's not good for the population when a lot of people are unemployed.   When they're replaced by new employers, some people will lose their job, but at the same time some people will get a job, so it will be balanced;3;8;1
2;19;0;1;2;The differences between the options are that in the option of getting robots instead of employees, there are only machines informed, while in the other option there are also people involved.;2;10;1
1;19;0;1;2;Being replaced by other employees means that at least they will have a job. However, is replaced by robots, the external employees wont have a job either.;2;10;1
2;19;0;2;3;robots are cheaper, to make more profit. ;4;10;1
2;19;0;1;2;Well its nicer to have humans instead of robots. In addition this contributes to creating jobs which is an important concern with robotisation. Its much nicer to manage a big group of people who you feel you help rather then 'managing'' robots. We all prefer having a human friend to a robot friend.;2;10;1
2;18;0;2;2;For the old employees it is not nice to be fired. I can imagine, from the old employees' perspective that it would not be nice when new employees come in your place instead of you. As a manager it would be easier to tell the old employees that they are being fired because of the developing technology, by replacing them with robots. ;2;4;1
2;18;0;2;3;I think that the robots can work efficiently compared with the humans because machines don't need to be motivated or rewarded or something. So it's much easier to give them tasks to the machines without having to give any attention. The same thing can not be said about employees.;2;4;1
2;19;0;2;2;Robots will help to avoid negative Organizational Citizenship Behavior, such as absence from work etc  Moreover, emotions that often have bad influence on job performance and productiveness will be removed.;2;10;1
1;21;0;2;3;Beacaue there will be less emotional problems;4;4;1
1;20;0;2;2;I know it makes no sense but intuitionally it seems more ethical for me to fire people on order to replace them by robots than by other people, just because robots are something different, and they also seem to me more efficient than humans although I know it was mentioned that the efficiency will be the same. It just intuitionally is more justifiable.;2;10;1
2;19;0;1;2;I think replacing humans by robots is not a good choice as you decrease the work availability for society whereas you replace it by new employees you maintain the same level of work availability.;2;10;1
1;18;0;1;2;I think it is less ethical to replace actual loyal employees with robots for cutting costs than replacing these employees with new employees. These new employees have a job now, otherwise if the old employees would have been replaced by robots, more people would have been unemployed. To think about the social and 'human' consequences, I think one should replace the old employees with new employees and not with robots/machines. ;2;10;1
1;20;0;1;2;I don't think it's ethical to use more robots, when a lot of people cannot find a job these days. That's why i would choose for the humans. Above all it delivers the same cost and quality.;6;4;1
1;21;0;1;3;Since there are preocupant number of people without a job, I don't think is correct to substitute people for robots. ;2;10;1
1;18;0;2;3;As an employee i would rather like i'm being replaced by a robot than i'm being replaced by a new employee. This because being replaced already sucks and when you find out it's by a new employee i would feel like i have failed. ;2;4;1
2;18;0;1;2;I see the pros and cons for both of the options. Using robots would decrease problems with employees in a specific way. For example, robots don't take maternity leave, they don't take paid sick days, they don't go on vacation etc. Except for that part there would be a lot of backlash for firing people.   The biggest reason why I chose to have humans over robots is because of the simple fact that robots cannot innovate. Robots do what they are programmed to do but humans do not have this limitation. A worker may find a new way of doing something or may come up with an idea which could help you in the long run. Though working with robots can increase efficiency employing workers is also a benefit to society. ;2;10;1
1;18;0;2;2;I think it is better to replace the workers by robots, because if they get replaced by other humans, they would get the feeling that they aren't good enough. They think other persons are better. Whereas if the workers get replaced by robots, they don't feel that way because humans can't beat robots.;2;4;1
2;19;0;1;3;I would prefer humans of robots, because they are able to motivated. and perhaps produce more output in the future. also working in an envirnment where humans work must be more motivational.;2;10;1
2;18;1;1;2;If I get replaced by a human being, that will mean that I have one less opponent in finding another job, because he already has a job, my old job.;2;4;1
1;18;1;2;2;I can understand it, when the company would replace me for a robot, because a robot is most of the times faster than me. But if i would be replaced with another employee, i would think that i wasn't good enough for the job. That that employee is better than me. ;2;4;1
1;19;1;1;2;I would prefer being replaced by an employee, because if a robot gets the job it will not even appreciate it and need it as much as I do. There is a competition of jobs in the world and unemployment exists. But if robots replaces many jobs then the unemployment in the world will increase because people are not needed anymore. ;2;10;1
2;19;1;2;3;I would feel disappointed in myself if I was replaced by another human. like I'm not good enough to do the job.;3;3;1
1;22;1;2;2;I think being replaced by a robot feels more like you're being replaced for something new. New and better technology which will perform your tasks better than you did. While being replaced by someone else feels more like you're not good at something you could be better at.;2;10;1
1;19;1;2;2;i would rather be replaced by a robot because a robot can maybe do things that i am not capable of. when i would me replaced by another employee, i would be hurt because than i could just as easily have stayed;2;10;1
2;21;1;1;3;If I will be replaced, then there must be a good explanation and if not I wish all the best for people in general. So if someone else can do the job, I don't have any problem with that.;2;10;1
2;17;1;1;2;If I can't have the job, i'd rather see someone else take it than see it disappear as a human job, this way at least one of the two keeps his job. While if you're replaced by a robot the job falls out en nobody has any benefit from that.;2;10;1
2;18;1;1;2;I would like to be replaced by another human being. If I was replaced by a robot, I would probably think that my work was useless, or very simple, because even a robot can do it.;2;10;1
1;18;1;1;2;Robots can do the job but they cannot adjust themselves. Humans can and therefore I find new employees the better option.;2;10;1
2;23;1;1;2;I would choice for the first option as it doesn't cut jobs;2;6;1
2;19;1;1;2;Since the technical output would be identical, there is no benefit of using robots instead of human beings. Hence I believe e new employee should be hired, as this brings an ethical component into the firm;2;10;1
2;18;1;1;3;if i dont get i job it wouldnt say that i also want that somebody else dont get a job. If i dont gain money from the company i would prefer that somebody else does to feed his children. Because with a robot replacement nobody gets money;3;1;1
2;18;1;1;2;I don't like the idea that something else is taking over my job. If i lose my job and someone else takes it, it means i did peforme bad or that he peformes better. If a robot takes my job its just something i can't do anything about;2;10;1
1;19;1;2;2;I would rather be replaced by a robot because if I would be replaced by an other employee it would feel like the other person is better than me.;2;4;1
2;20;1;1;3;It feels more humane to be replaced by another employee, atleast someone is getting a salary of the work they're doing. If I were to be replaced by a robot, the job won't be availabe for a human, therefore the number of jobs available for people would decrease and less people would have a job. If this were to happen all the time, the total income of people would decline and we would experience and economic challenge.;4;10;1
2;20;1;2;2;I would prefer being substituted by a robot because I'm pretty sure can execute a task almost perfectly. If I were to be replaced by a human, it would be a sign to me that I won't be good enough at the task and that the person that is substituting for me, executes the task better which would give me a shitty feeling.;2;8;1
1;17;1;1;3;i would prefer to be replaced by another employee because my qualities would be better recognized compared to the other employee. If a robot replaced me people would then only see its mistakes and they would compare its performance to people's performance in general, not my performance.;2;10;1
1;18;1;1;2;When I get replaced whit a person, at least that person has a job. When I get replaced by a robot I lose my job and there isn't a benefit for anyone else.;3;10;1
2;19;1;2;3;If I am replaced by a robot it means that technology is very enhanced, but when I am replaced by another employee it means I am just not good enough.;2;10;1
2;18;1;2;2;When you get replaced by a robot, you don't have to make place for other people. You have to make place for innovation and I think that's a good thing. I think people can understand that.;2;4;1
2;19;1;2;3;If I get replaced by a new employee, it means I'm not good enough for the job. If I get replaced by a robot, it means that it's more efficient to use robots.;2;10;1
2;19;1;2;2;If i'm going to be replaced I'd rather be replaced by something not human. If i get replaced by another human, i feel like I wasn't doing my job good enough, and therefore i got replaced. I wanna be the best at anything i do so if a robot replaces me, its easier for me to accept. A robot can perform the same function again and again without making mistakes, while humans generally make a mistake eventually.;2;1;1
2;22;1;1;2;because if a person take my place is better than a machine such as a robot;4;10;1
2;20;1;2;2;I prefer being replaced by an robot,because the difference I perceive with a human being is that a robot doesn't make mistakes and I can't get jealous on a robot that it's getting my job, a robot can't do anything about the fact that I'm replaced.;3;10;1
1;19;1;1;3;Being replaced by the robot would imply that robots are more qualified and intelligent than people. Thus, I would prefer to be replaced by another person. ;2;10;1
1;19;1;1;2;If I'm replaced by some other person, I will be replaced by something human, so basically there is no job lost. I do lost my job but the humanity still has the job. If I was replaced by a robot, it means that humanity is losing jobs to technology. That scares me. ;2;4;1
2;18;1;2;2;I would rather be replaced by a machine than by someone else. That is because in my opinion, machine's are more efficient than humans and therefore I would mind it less to be replaced by a machine. If I would be replaced by someone else, I would get the feeling I wasn't doing my work right or fast enough, and my company has found someone else who would do it better than me. ;2;10;1
1;21;1;2;2;I would prefer to be replaced by a robot, as in that way I would have a feeling of  well, nothing can be done about it, as robots are manufactured to work in a certain way'. Whereas if I were to be replaced by an actual human being, I would probably take it personally and slightly question my own capabilities.;3;10;1
1;19;1;2;2;I would prefer a robot because then it's not my fault. There isn't somebody that is doing better but an 'it'. And that's something I Can't do anything about.;2;10;1
1;18;1;1;1;When I am replaced by a robot, it makes me feel like I and my work are irrelevant to the company. When I am replaced by a new employee, it makes me feel like I still have skills that matter, even though I am replaced. ;2;4;1
1;26;1;1;2;I would prefer being replaced by a person because it is unnfair that a person loses her job and is replaced by a machine;4;10;2
2;19;1;2;2;If I was replaced by another person, that means the person is better than me. If I was replaced by a robot, it didn't mean that I'm not good enough for my job, but that a robot is cheaper than me. ;3;4;1
2;19;1;2;3;robots are more reliable then humands and therfore i would choose robots, so option 1 was robot and 2 was employees;2;10;1
2;18;1;2;2;i can learn what the other can do why i have to leave. A robot is always more efficient then me. ;3;10;1
2;18;1;1;3;If the quality and costs of replenishment are the same, then it is better to hire new employee as it is always better to have contact with a person than with robot. There is no way robots or machines can replace people's mind.;2;10;1
1;19;1;1;2;Being replaced, in the first place, does not awake good emotions with me. However, if there is no other way I prefer being replaced by a person, not a robot. At least some one else will get a chance to work and help his/her family. Also being replaced by the robot causes personal discomfort. ;2;10;1
2;18;1;1;2;I dont think being replaced by a robot is fair. A robot can probably work way faster and better.  If another employee takes over my job i will feel less screwed.;2;1;1
1;19;1;2;2;I would like to be replaced by a robot, because then i have got the feeling that Im good at the job, but technology beats me. When another employee replaces me, I get the feeling that im bad at my job.;3;4;1
2;22;1;2;2;If I would be replaced by another employee, I would feel rejected, thus I would rather have a robot replacing me.;3;10;1
1;18;1;2;2;I would think that a robot is more effective and works more efficiently than a person. Therefore, I would understand my replacement by a robot. Whereas, if I was a good worker and would be replaced by another employee, I wouldn't really understand this. Because the company would be unsure of the performance of the new employee and maybe I would be better at the job than the new employee.;3;10;1
2;18;1;1;2;I feel that a robot would make the job boring for other employees because they cannot socialise with is. Another employee would be better because it is fun to get to know other persons, even though it is not you meeting this person.;2;4;1
2;19;1;2;2;With the person, there's someone with a new job, this is positive. But this person is also better than me (they think).  With the robot, the company has a good reason to replace me, because it's cheaper I think.;3;10;1
2;18;1;2;2;If a robot replaces me I wouldnt care as much as when a person replaces me because I would think it is unfair for me.;2;10;1
2;18;1;2;2;if a human replaces me it means that someone is better. if a robot replaces me it's not a human he can do things that i can not. ;2;10;1
2;18;1;2;1;If i would get replaced because my company thinks i'm not working well, it would be way more worse if a robot would replace me because robots are way more efficient. And I would not like it when a human being would replace me because eventually we are the same and they would think he or she is better in doing the job;2;4;1
1;20;1;2;2;because I think that I will be able to get a new job, and the firm will compensate me for  volunteering , I believe in myself in my competences so i think i stand a better chance than my colleague in finding a new job;2;10;1
2;24;1;1;2;Well in first place it didn't really matter to me. But in the end I thought maybe someone needs the money too. So I chose for the employee for he or she maybe has a family they need to provide. A robot is maybe more productive but i'd rather give another human being a chance.;4;1;1
2;18;1;2;2;Maybe it is sort of jealousy. You are jealous of the other employee who have the chance to work instead of you.;2;4;1
1;18;1;2;2;it feels as kind of failure when you are replaced by another employee, while being replaced by a robot feels as being replaced by technology, which is more understandable.;3;10;1
2;21;1;1;2;the robot techonic is not mature;3;7;3
1;18;1;2;2;Some competitive feelings. A human could be better than me. because of their experience, education and such. However a robot has abilities what no human could have. So if a robot replaces me, I would not have bitter feelings, because does things which are humanly impossible.;2;4;1
1;18;1;2;2;a new employee is comparable to me, so if I would be replaced by someone else I would feel like the other person is better. Otherwise, why would they replace me? It's not possible compare a human being to a robot, so if that would happen I would blame myself less.;3;1;1
2;18;1;2;2;i think robots can be made more capable than humans. so robots can do more things than humans.   If i would be replaced by a robot i think i could accept that because robots are better. (in my opinion)    if i would be replaced by a human, i would began to doubt about myself and my capabilities. i would not feel happy, because i would really feel replaced because i wasn't good enough.;2;4;1
2;19;1;2;2;Robots cant's say that they are sick or so, so that's why i prefer the robots above new employees.;6;10;1
2;20;1;2;2;Als je vervangen wordt door een andere medewerker voel je jezelf nutteloos omdat iemand dus hetzelfde kan voor minder geld. Door een robot is minder erg omdat het technologische vooruitgang is.;2;10;1
1;19;1;1;2;As there is no difference in the quality or productivity level, I would prefer a person replacing me rather than a robot. This because the person replacing me was unemployed and I would like to give him a sense of financial independency and all the other emotions and benefits associated with working. Also if we both are unemployment, the unemployment rate goes up and that is not good. ;4;4;1
1;19;1;2;1;Die andere werknemer zou dan beter zijn dan ik, terwijl ik daar al een hele tijd werk. Een robot zou het ook op een andere manier doen dus dat zou ik minder erg vinden.;3;4;1
1;17;1;2;3;In the case I would be replaced by a robot I would have more understanding towards the replacement, since robots can be more productive than human beings. This would not make me feel bad about myself or my performance.  Whenever I would be replaced by another/new employee I assume that I am not doing my work/job as well as my replacement. This would make me feel bad about myself since I am not good enough for the company/the work.;2;4;1
2;19;1;1;2;Nowadays more company's are replacing work that used to be done by humans and I don't like this, because people still need to earn money to life from ;2;4;1
2;20;1;2;2;Losing from one other human, feels more as failure than losing from a mechanism that has been developed by hundreds if not even thousands humans (scientists). It might sound a little bit far-fetched but for example I would not care losing a running game versus a cheeta as this animal is totally different endowed  compared to me. However, I could be disappointed if I lost a game running against a classmate of mine. It is not a shame losing of something/somebdoy that has in the beginning better advantages/posibilities than you to win, as it is losing from somebody/something that has more or less equal capabilities. It is in the last case more confronting, it basically feels more like that it is your own fault that you lost, not because of the situation or opponent;2;10;1
2;24;1;2;2;It's the future, wherein robots take over our jobs. So in that case the same economic output is delivered, but people don't have to work anymore to deliver that output. In an utopia that could mean that the people generally don't have to work anymore, but still earn a living, and have all the free time to do whatever they want. However, if replaced by another employee, that's not really helping the development. ;2;10;1
